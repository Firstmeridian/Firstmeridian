## Hi, I’m Firstmeridian 👋

I’m a friendly maker who builds AI-powered prototypes and turns them into reliable systems. I like working across **Python / C# / Java**, and I’m especially interested in **multi-agent AI**, **computer vision (OpenCV)**, and **mixed reality (HoloLens)**—with a strong “ship it, measure it, improve it” mindset.

### What I’m into
- **AI & Multi-agent systems**: orchestrating tools/agents to solve real tasks
- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV pipelines, perception + data flow
- **Mixed Reality**: HoloLens experiences that connect vision + interaction
- **Microservices & backend engineering**: designing services that are observable and maintainable
- **Data & background processing**: turning messy inputs into usable signals

### Platforms I like to build on
- **Windows / Windows Phone** (nostalgia + engineering scars)
- **WSL** for day-to-day development workflows

### Currently
- Exploring better patterns for **agent architectures** (planning, tools, memory, evaluation)
- Keeping projects small, practical, and well-documented

### Tech I often use
- **Python** (AI, automation, data, CV)
- **C# / .NET** (Windows, services, MR tooling)
- **Java** (services, integration, reliability work)
